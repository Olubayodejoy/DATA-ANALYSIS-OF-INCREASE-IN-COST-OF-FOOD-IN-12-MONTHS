This graph visualizes the percentage increase in food costs over a year, from October 2022 to September 2023. The data reveals a downward trend in the rate of food cost increases. The increase peaked at 10% in November 2022, and from that point, there was a steady decline, with the rate falling to just below 7% by September 2023.

Key Observations:
The sharpest increase was in November 2022, followed by a decline in the following months.
There were brief stabilizations in February and April 2023, but the overall trend shows a reduction in food price inflation.
By the end of the observation period in September 2023, food cost increases had dropped to their lowest at around 6%.
This trend is important for consumers and policymakers as it reflects the inflationary pressures on food prices, which could affect household budgets and economic decisions.
